Living Map iOS SDK Build and Deployment Tasks
=============================================

(c) 2020 Living Map Ltd.

NOTE: '$', below, denotes the shell prompt.  All commands should be run in the
      same directory as the Makefile.

The Living Map iOS SDK projects use 'make' to run build-related tasks.  Commands
(or "targets" as make calls them) may be preceded by a number of configuration
options.  For example:

    $ SDK=aa make test
    
This command would run the unit tests for the Airline Accelerator SDK.

The Makefile is intended to be used by Living Map developers and automated
systems.  It is NOT intended for use by end-users wishing to use the framework.

Most of the heavy-lifting is done by the associated 'tasks.sh' shell script.

The following targets are available:

help
====

    $ make
    $ make help

Display a short summary of available targets and their options.  This is the default
target.  The Makefile is self-documenting; new targets (with correctly formatted
documentation) will automatically appear in the summary help.  Refer to the Makefile
for instructions.

binary
======

    $ make binary
    $ SDK=live PLATFORM=simulator CONFIG=release make binary
    
Build binary (distributable) versions of the Living Map SDKs.  The built frameworks are
intended for inclusion in end-user apps.  A number of options are available:

SDK      - The SDK(s) to build.  Choose from all, sdk, live or aa
PLATFORM - The iOS platform to target.  Choose from all, simulator or device. 'all'
           will build a universal framework that contains both Arm and Intel code.
CONFIG   - Whether to build debug or release versions of the framework(s).  Release
           versions have the debugging symbols stripped and is the default.

test
====

    $ make test
    $ SDK=aa DEVICE=phone make test
    
Run unit tests.  Options are:

SDK      - The SDK(s) to test.  Choose from all, sdk, live or aa
DEVICE   - A regular expression to use to select the specific device to run the tests on.
           The first device found that matches is used.  The devices are generated by
           running the 'instruments -s' command.
    
clean
=====

    $ make clean
    $ SDK=aa make clean
    
Remove intermediate build files.  Options are:

SDK      - The SDK(s) to test.
